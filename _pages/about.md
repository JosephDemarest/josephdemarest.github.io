I'm a generalist software engineer with a passion for building solutions to complex problems. I have a strong foundation in Python, C++, and SQL, and I'm experienced in a wide range of technologies, including automation, DevOps, ETL pipelines, and REST APIs. I'm a quick learner and I'm always looking for new challenges.

I'm a master at pulling together various technologies to make any solution to any problem. I'm a jack of all trades, but a master of none. I'm passionate about open-source and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.

If you’d like to learn more about my work or explore potential collaborations, feel free to connect with me at [Joseph@Demarest.dev](mailto:Joseph@Demarest.dev) or visit [demarest.dev/projects](https://demarest.dev/projects/). Let’s build something remarkable together.
