Engineered a closed-loop IoT system using an ESP32 to monitor soil moisture levels and automatically activate a water pump based on a set threshold. Developed custom C++ firmware for the microcontroller and a Python script to log moisture data over time via the MQTT protocol, demonstrating a full sense-process-act cycle.
