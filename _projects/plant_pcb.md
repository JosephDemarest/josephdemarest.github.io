## Overview

The Plant PCB project represents a smart, scalable approach to environmental monitoring. It integrates multiple sensors on a custom PCB to measure parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and ambient light—all enclosed in a durable 3D-printed case for outdoor reliability.

## Design and Engineering

- **Custom PCB Engineering:**  
  Designed in KiCad, the board incorporates various sensor interfaces, wireless communication modules, and power management circuitry tailored for low-energy operation.
- **Robust Enclosure Design:**  
  Using SolidWorks, the enclosure is optimized for outdoor use. It features weather-resistant sealing and an ergonomic form factor that facilitates easy mounting in diverse environments.
- **Modularity and Scalability:**  
  The architecture is modular, allowing for the integration of additional sensors or communication modules, making it adaptable to a wide range of monitoring scenarios.
