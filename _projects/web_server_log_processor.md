Developed a Python script to perform a classic ETL task: parsing unstructured web server log files using regular expressions to extract structured data like IP addresses, timestamps, and request paths. Utilized Pandas to clean, transform, and aggregate the extracted data to calculate key metrics such as unique visitors, page views per session, and 404 error rates. Loaded the final, aggregated data into a PostgreSQL database, creating a clean dataset for further analysis.
